# Building a Tech Blog with Next.js and MDX

Hello! Today we'll explore how to build a modern tech blog using Next.js and MDX.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that combines Markdown and JSX, allowing you to use React components within your Markdown documents.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Interactive Component</h2>
      <Button onClick={() => alert('Clicked!')}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Simplicity of Markdown**: Use standard Markdown syntax
2. **Leverage React Components**: Create dynamic and interactive content
3. **Type Safety**: Use with TypeScript for type safety

## Code Highlighting

MDX supports syntax highlighting for code blocks:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
  title: string;
  content: string;
  publishedAt: Date;
}

const createPost = (data: BlogPost): BlogPost => {
  return {
    ...data,
    publishedAt: new Date(),
  };
};
```

## Conclusion

Combining Next.js and MDX creates a powerful and flexible blog platform. It offers both the performance of static site generation and the dynamic features of React, providing an excellent developer experience.
