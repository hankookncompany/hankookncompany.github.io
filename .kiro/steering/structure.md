# Project Structure

## Current Organization
```

│   └── steering/       # AI guidance documents
└── (project files to be added)
```

## Recommended Structure Patterns
- Keep source code in dedicated directories (e.g., `src/`, `lib/`)
- Separate tests from source code (`tests/`, `__tests__/`, `test/`)
- Configuration files at project root
- Documentation in `docs/` or alongside code
- Build artifacts in `build/`, `dist/`, or `target/`

## File Organization Principles
- Group related functionality together
- Use clear, descriptive naming conventions
- Maintain consistent directory structure
- Keep configuration files organized and documented
- Separate concerns appropriately

## Naming Conventions
- Use consistent case conventions (camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case)
- Choose descriptive names over abbreviations
- Follow language/framework conventions
- Be consistent across the entire project
